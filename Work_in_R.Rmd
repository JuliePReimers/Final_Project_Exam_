# Installing packages
We install all the packages needed for doing textmining and sentiment analysis
Becauce Sentida won´t install just by using install.packages code regardless of R version I use the devtools packages and get the package through a GitHub account. And open it through the library to see if done correctly. 

```{r install packages 1} 
#install.packages("devtools")
#install.packages("usethis")

devtools::install_github("Guscode/Sentida")
library(devtools)
library(Sentida)
```

```{r install packages}
#install.packages("here")
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("pdftools")
#install.packages("qpdf")
#install.packages("tidytext")
#install.packages("tokenizers")
#install.packages("textdata")
#install.packages("ggwordcloud")
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Then we open them trough the library

```{r open packages 01}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(dplyr)
library(qpdf)
library(textdata)
library(knitr)
library(here)
library(pdftools)
library(textdata)
library(tidytext)
library(ggwordcloud)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Upload data into R
We read the, in lapsapi created data into R 

```{r read data into R}
all_data <- read.csv("https://labs.statsbiblioteket.dk/labsapi/api/aviser/export/fields?query=%28%22dybb%C3%B8l%22%20OR%20%22slesvig%22%20OR%20%22Als%22%20OR%20%22holsten%22%29%20AND%20%22krig%22%20AND%20py%3A1864&fields=link&fields=timestamp&fields=fulltext_org&fields=familyId&fields=lplace&max=-1&structure=header&structure=content&format=CSV")
```


# Gather the information we need from the dataset
We want to compare the newspapers published in Copenhagen vs. the newspapers published in Ribe, Tønder and Haderslev. From looking at the tibble of our dataset we know, that the column called lplace refers to the publication place of each newspaper therefore we create a dataset only with the data publication place = Copenhagen, which we can do by using the filter() and choosing "København" as our lplace. We define this dataset outcome as data_cph and load to see if done correctly and to see the data 


```{r create dataset only containing data from Copenhagen}
data_cph <- all_data %>% 
  filter(lplace == "København")
```

We do the same to create a dataset only with the data publication place = Tønder, Haderslev and Ribe just by adding a | which stands for "and" and define this outcome as data_slw and again load to see if done correctly and to see the data 

```{r create dataset only containing data from Tønder, Haderslev and Ribe}
data_slw <- filter(all_data, lplace=="Tønder" | lplace=="Haderslev" | lplace=="Ribe")
```

# Analysing the data
We now have two seperate datasets, one containing all the data published in Copenhagen and another one with all the data published in either Tønder, Ribe or Haderslev. For the Schleswig dataset we choose these 3 cities because of their location in the center of the happening and because of their dataamount. 
We now want to start by looking at our fulltext_org column, because it is the column on which we are going to work. 
```{r look at the fulltext column, eval=FALSE}
all_data %>% 
  select(fulltext_org)
```
# Sentiment analyis
First, it is important to state that we choose not to remove any stopwords from our dataset. The reason behind is that we work with the package sentida, which analyses by using not only the analysed word, but also the context before and behind this word. Therefore, to get the best possible result, we choose not to remove any stopwords that possible could be a part of the context. 
As mentioned we use the sentida package. Here we compare the total value and the mean value from each dataset with each other. 

```{r use sentiment analysis on slw dataset}
sentiment_slw_total <- data_slw$fulltext_org %>%
  sentida(output = "total")

sentiment_slw_mean <- data_slw$fulltext_org %>%
  sentida(output = "mean")
```


```{r use sentiment analysis on cph dataset}
sentiment_cph_total <- data_cph$fulltext_org %>%
  sentida(output = "total")

sentiment_cph_mean <- data_cph$fulltext_org %>%
  sentida(output = "mean")
```

#Comparison
We load our environment to see the sentiment analysis, from which we are able to compare the two areas. 

```{r see the sentiments}
sentiment_slw_total
sentiment_slw_mean

sentiment_cph_total
sentiment_cph_mean
```
We see that the newspapers from the Schleswig region are much more negative than the ones published in Copenhagen. 


# Visualization
We want to create a visualization that shows the amount of articles published in each location, based of the lplace column. 

```{r visualization showing number of articles published in 1864}
ggplot(data = all_data, aes(y=lplace, fill= "Number of articles"))+
  geom_bar()+
  ggtitle("Number of published articles mentioning the Schleswig Holstein conflict in 1864")+
  xlab("Amount of articles")+
  ylab("Publication location")
```
Here we see that there are published a lot more in Copenhagen than in the other locations, which could effect the following visualizations. 



# Visualization
We want to create a visualization that shows the individually newspapers sentiment value. For this we need to separate the slw dataset into three datasets. 


```{r separate the slw dataset into one for Tønder, one for Haderslev and one for Ribe}
data_tonder <- filter(all_data, lplace == "Tønder")
data_haderslev <- filter(all_data, lplace == "Haderslev")
data_ribe <- filter(all_data, lplace == "Ribe") 

sentiment_tonder <- sentida(data_tonder$fulltext_org, output = "mean")
sentiment_haderslev <- sentida(data_haderslev$fulltext_org, output = "mean")
sentiment_ribe <- sentida(data_ribe$fulltext_org, output = "mean")
```
 
# Visualization
 Then we use ggplot to create the visualization and choose some colors
```{r visualization, showing sentiment analysis in the different regions, 1864}
ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = "Tønder", y = sentiment_tonder), fill = "pink")+
  geom_col(aes(x = "Ribe", y = sentiment_ribe), fill = "maroon")+
  geom_col(aes(x = "Haderslev", y = sentiment_haderslev), fill = "salmon")+
  geom_col(aes(x = "København", y = sentiment_cph_mean), fill = "purple")+ 
  ggtitle("Sentiment analysis of newspapers mentioning the Schleswig Holstein colflict 1864")+ 
  xlab("Publication Location")+
  ylab("Sentiment score (Sentida)")
```
From this visualization we can see that the most positive mention comes from the regions Copenhagen, Tønder and Ribe and that the most negative mention comes from Haderslev. 



# Loading datasets from 1862, 1866 and 1868
Because we wish to see how the publishing amount and the sentiment analysis evolve throughout the years before and after our 1864 period, we load three other datasets from respectively 1862, 1866 and 1868. 

```{r read data from 1862}
all_data_1862 <- read.csv("https://labs.statsbiblioteket.dk/labsapi/api/aviser/export/fields?query=%28%22dybb%C3%B8l%22%20OR%20%22slesvig%22%20OR%20%22Als%22%20OR%20%22holsten%22%29%20AND%20%22krig%22%20AND%20py%3A1862&fields=link&fields=timestamp&fields=fulltext_org&fields=familyId&fields=lplace&max=-1&structure=header&structure=content&format=CSV")
```

```{r read data from 1866}
all_data_1866 <- read_csv("https://labs.statsbiblioteket.dk/labsapi/api/aviser/export/fields?query=%28%22dybb%C3%B8l%22%20OR%20%22slesvig%22%20OR%20%22Als%22%20OR%20%22holsten%22%29%20AND%20%22krig%22%20AND%20py%3A1866&fields=link&fields=timestamp&fields=fulltext_org&fields=familyId&fields=lplace&max=-1&structure=header&structure=content&format=CSV")
```

```{r read data from 1868}
all_data_1868 <- read_csv("https://labs.statsbiblioteket.dk/labsapi/api/aviser/export/fields?query=%28%22dybb%C3%B8l%22%20OR%20%22slesvig%22%20OR%20%22Als%22%20OR%20%22holsten%22%29%20AND%20%22krig%22%20AND%20py%3A1868&fields=link&fields=timestamp&fields=fulltext_org&fields=familyId&fields=lplace&max=-1&structure=header&structure=content&format=CSV")
```
To create a visualization, we need the sentiment values in a separate column, which we can create with the lapply() function

```{r making a column containing the sentiment values}
all_data_1862$sentiment <- lapply(all_data_1862$fulltext_org,sentida, output = "mean")
all_data$sentiment <- lapply(all_data$fulltext_org,sentida, output = "mean")
all_data_1866$sentiment <- lapply(all_data_1866$fulltext_org,sentida, output = "mean")
all_data_1868$sentiment <- lapply(all_data_1868$fulltext_org,sentida, output = "mean")
```

# Visualization 
Now we create a visualization showing the amount of published articles in the individually years

```{r visualization showing the amount of published articles in the individually years}
ggplot()+ 
  geom_col(aes(x = "1862", y = nrow(all_data_1862)), fill = "deepskyblue3")+
  geom_col(aes(x = "1864", y = nrow(all_data)), fill = "blue4")+
  geom_col(aes(x = "1866", y = nrow(all_data_1866)), fill = "blue3")+
  geom_col(aes(x = "1868", y = nrow(all_data_1868)), fill = "deepskyblue3")+
  ggtitle("Published articles mentioning Sleswig Holstein")+ 
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Number of published articles")
```
From which we see that publishing amount of articles mentioning Schleswig Holstein conflict is highest in the year of happening and lowest in the years before and gradually decreases in the years following. 

# Visualization

We reload the previously shown visualization showing the in amount of published articles in 1864. 

```{r visualization, showing publication based on location}
ggplot(all_data, aes(y=lplace, fill = "Number of articles"))+
  geom_bar()+
  ggtitle("Number of articles about the Schleswig Holstein conflict 1864")+ 
  xlab("Amount of articles")+
  ylab("Publication location")
```
We do the same thing for the other three datasets so that we later can compare the four years. 

```{r number of articles 1862}
ggplot(all_data_1862, aes(y=lplace, fill = "Number of articles"))+
  geom_bar()+
  ggtitle("Number of articles about the Schleswig Holstein conflict 1862")+ 
  xlab("Amount of articles")+
  ylab("Publication location")
```

```{r number of articles 1866}
ggplot(all_data_1866, aes(y=lplace, fill = "Number of articles"))+
  geom_bar()+
  ggtitle("Number of articles about the Schleswig Holstein conflict 1866")+ 
  xlab("Amount of articles")+
  ylab("Publication location")
```

```{r number of articles 1868}
ggplot(all_data_1868, aes(y=lplace, fill = "Number of articles"))+
  geom_bar()+
  ggtitle("Number of articles about the Schleswig Holstein conflict 1868")+ 
  xlab("Amount of articles")+
  ylab("Publication location")
```
# Short comparison, to be continued in the section "Comparison" 
From a short overview we can see some changes, for example is the 1864 visualization the only one containing articles from Aarhus, whereas the others also contain articles published under the different spelling Århus. There are also changes in Haderslev and Frederikssund, which aren´t publishing anything at all in the year 1866. By looking further in Haderslev we also see that Haderslev is the location publishing second most throughout 1862, but then decreases throughout the following years. 

# Visualization
Because of the significant changes in Haderslevs publishing amount throughout the years, we create four  visualization that shows the publisher and the amount of articles published in each year. 


```{r visualization, showing the publisher of the published articles 1862}
ggplot(all_data_1862, aes(y=familyId))+
  geom_bar()+
  ggtitle("Amount of the articles mentioning the Schleswig Holstein conflict published in 1862, based on the publisher")
```

```{r visualization, showing the publisher of the published articles 1864}
ggplot(all_data, aes(y=familyId))+
  geom_bar()+
  ggtitle("Amount of the articles mentioning the Schleswig Holstein conflict published in 1864, based on the publisher")
```

```{r visualization, showing the publisher of the published articles 1866}
ggplot(all_data_1866, aes(y=familyId))+
  geom_bar()+
  ggtitle("Amount of the articles mentioning the Schleswig Holstein conflict published in 1866, based on the publisher")
```

```{r visualization, showing the publisher of the published articles 1868}
ggplot(all_data_1868, aes(y=familyId))+
  geom_bar()+
  ggtitle("Amount of the articles mentioning the Schleswig Holstein conflict published in 1868, based on the publisher")
```


We know that the Dannevirke 1838 newspaper is a newspaper from Haderslev, so if we look only at the publishing amount of Dannevirke 1838, we see that they suddenly disappear in 1866 and then show up again under the new name Dannevirke 1867 in the dataset from 1868, which could mean that the Dannevirke newspaper, based in Haderslev closed after Haderslev became prussia and then opened up under a new name in 1967. To confirm og deny this theory, we seach a bit on Google and find a article from "Grænseforeningen" about the newspaper Dannevirke, which tells us that prussia closed it after the war in 1684, but that the reopened under the name "Haderslev avis" in 1867, but then decided to change it back to Dannevirke, but this time as Dannevirke 1867, which explains both why there aren´t any publications in 1966 and why there are some in 1868. This is a good example for showing that searching and analysis in R actually can tell us something, that may be valuable to research. 

# Visualization, showing the average sentiment scores from 1862, 1866 and 1868. 
We also want to compare the sentidascores from the years after and before. For this we need to unlist the sentiment columns in our four datasets, since the column we made came out in a list format, but in order to use the sentiment columns for calculating the average scores for different locations we need the values as numeric values. After, we use the group_by_tool, to make groups of articles based on lplace, which makes it possible for us to use the mean() function to calculate the average scores for each regions of publication. We make the visualization for all of the four datasets. 

```{r unlist dataset from 1862}
data_1862_new <- all_data_1862 %>% 
  mutate(unlist(sentiment))
```

```{r calculate average sentidascore 1862}
mean_sentiment_1862 <- data_1862_new %>% 
  group_by(lplace) %>%
  summarise(mean_sentiment = mean(`unlist(sentiment)`))
```

```{r visualization 1862}
ggplot(data = mean_sentiment_1862)+ 
  geom_col(aes(x = mean_sentiment, y = lplace))+
  ggtitle("Average sentiment in articles based on location of publication 1862")+ 
  xlab("Location")+
  ylab("Average sentida-score for articles published in each city")
```

```{r unlist dataset from 1864}
data_1864_new <- all_data %>% 
  mutate(unlist(sentiment))
```

```{r calculate average sentidascore 1864}
mean_sentiment_1864 <- data_1864_new %>% 
  group_by(lplace) %>%
  summarise(mean_sentiment = mean(`unlist(sentiment)`))
```

```{r visualization 1864}
ggplot(data = mean_sentiment_1864)+ 
  geom_col(aes(x = mean_sentiment, y = lplace))+
  ggtitle("Average sentiment in articles based on location of publication 1864")+ 
  xlab("Location")+
  ylab("Average sentida-score for articles published in each city")
```

```{r unlist dataset from 1866}
data_1866_new <- all_data_1866 %>% 
  mutate(unlist(sentiment))
```


```{r calculate average sentidascores 1866}
mean_sentiment_1866 <- data_1866_new %>% 
  group_by(lplace) %>%
  summarise(mean_sentiment = mean(`unlist(sentiment)`))
```

```{r visualization 1866}
ggplot(data = mean_sentiment_1866)+ 
  geom_col(aes(x = mean_sentiment, y = lplace))+
  ggtitle("Average sentiment in articles based on location of publication 1862")+ 
  xlab("Location")+
  ylab("Average sentida-score for articles published in each city")
```

```{r unlist dataset from 1868}
data_1868_new <- all_data_1868 %>% 
  mutate(unlist(sentiment))
```


```{r calculate average sentidascore 1868}
mean_sentiment_1868 <- data_1868_new %>% 
  group_by(lplace) %>%
  summarise(mean_sentiment = mean(`unlist(sentiment)`))
```


```{r visualization 1868}
ggplot(data = mean_sentiment_1868)+ 
  geom_col(aes(x = mean_sentiment, y = lplace))+
  ggtitle("Average sentiment in articles based on location of publication 1862")+ 
  xlab("Location")+
  ylab("Average sentida-score for articles published in each city")
```
# Sentiment analysis on the primary historians presentation of the Schlesvig Holstein conflict
For good measure we also make an sentiment analysis on our primary source texts for the historians point of view. Therefore we upload three different pdf text into R and use the sentida as previously, one from 1900, one from 1973 and another one from Danmarkshistorien.dk, which still is updated regularly. 

```{r sentiment analysis on historian texts}
# Sentida af Danmarkshistorien.dks side om krigen 1864 
sentiment_dh <- pdf_text("data/1864.pdf") %>% 
  sentida(output = "total")

#Sentida af tidsskrift om krisen, udgivet i historisk tidsskrift 1973: 

sentiment_bismarck_og_europa <- pdf_text("data/Bismarck_Europa_og_SH.pdf") %>% 
  sentida(output = "total")

#Sentida af bogen Den anden Slesvigske Krig 1864, udgivet i 1900

sentiment_np <- pdf_text("data/Den_anden_slesvigske_krig.pdf") %>% 
  sentida(output = "total")
```

# Visualization
To make an comparison easier we make a visualization, showing the sentiment values

```{r visualization, showing sentiment values for the historian texts}
ggplot()+
  geom_col(aes(y = "Danmarkshistorien.dk", x = sentiment_dh), fill = "darkgreen")+
  geom_col(aes(y = "Bismarck og Europa", x = sentiment_bismarck_og_europa), fill = "yellow")+
  geom_col(aes(y = "NP: Den anden slesvigske krig", x = sentiment_np), fill = "darkred")+ 
  ggtitle("Sentiment analysis of three different sourcetexts from the present, 1973 and 1900")+ 
  xlab("Text")+
  ylab("Sentiment score (Sentida)")
```
Here we can see, that the closets text from 1900 is the most negative text, which makes sense compared to the articles and the time period of publishing, where you could assume, that people still would have strong negative feelings, depending on the authors provenance. On the other hand, Danmarkshistorien.dk seems to be strongly positive, but this could be due to the article beeing mostly neutral written, wheras Bismarck and Europa, which also is on the positive side could be due to the publishing date beeing not only many years after 1864, but also after the reunion in 1920 and further development of the society. 

# Mapping
As a finish up we decided to create a map, that visualize our work here in R, but only the data and work concerning 1864. 
For making a map we need further packages, which we install and open trough the library. Furthermore, we need to create our own datasheet, here we use google sheets. For the data we use our lplace and our previously found sentiment for each of the choosen lplaces. Other than that, we need to find coordinates for our lplaces for R to read and place on a in the leaflet package premade map of Denmark. Herefore we use google earth and write the given coordinates into the google sheet. To make the sheet accessibly here in R we could use the read_sheet function, but an even easier way is to open the files section and automatically upload a csv. document into the files section in R, from where you can click on the file and chose import dataset and it uploads it to the environment. 

```{r install packages needed for mapping}
#install.packages("googlesheets4")
#install.packages("leaflet")
```


```{r open packages needed for mapping}
library(googlesheets4)
library(leaflet)
```

# Data sheet created in Excel
We read the in excel created datasheet (described in section Data Acquisition) into R.
```{r read the dataset}
data_sheet_SA2022 <- read.csv("data/data_sheet-SA2022.csv")
```

We use leaflet to create a map of denmark and the data sheet for the needed locations
```{r map without descriptions}
DANmap <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Thunderforest.SpinalMap") %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = data_sheet_SA2022$Longitude, 
             lat = data_sheet_SA2022$Latitude,
             popup = data_sheet_SA2022$Description)
DANmap
```

We add some descriptions, containing the sentiment values, both mean and total, and the lplace and the amount of articles published. 
```{r map with descriptions}
DANmap_notes <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Thunderforest.SpinalMap") %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = data_sheet_SA2022$Longitude, 
             lat = data_sheet_SA2022$Latitude,
             popup=paste(
               "Lplace:", data_sheet_SA2022$Lplace, "<br>",
               "Sentiment_mean:", data_sheet_SA2022$Sentiment_mean, "<br>",
               "Sentiment_total:", data_sheet_SA2022$Sentiment_total,"<br>",
               "Newspaper count:", data_sheet_SA2022$Antal_newspapers),
             clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
DANmap_notes
```
